Project:
============================================================
Post-Quantum Cryptography primitives for constrained devices



Deliverables Details
============================================================

1. qemu-vms - Some of the qemu kernels used for testing
2. RaspiEmulator_KernelOnly - Raspy Emulator with configuration files
3. References  - All the references used during the develop
4. report_source_tex - Tex file for the project
5. source_code - The code snippets and cryptography algorithms used during the projects to test running of various classical and post-quantum safe cryptographic algorithms and
		  test the characteristics runtime.
6. mid-report.pdf - The  main report which was already submitted.


Source Code Contributors:

The code base has been heavily adopted from open-source code , available online, we have implemented additional test-cases and have will make rigorous analysis switching between multiple modules to get eh 
desired results.
